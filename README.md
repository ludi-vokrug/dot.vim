#Just another NVIM config file

Feel free to use, fork and copy that file.

#Install HOWTO:

1) Install https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug, pay attention to readme.
2) Add init.vim file in /home/{user}/.config/nvim/
3) Start nvim and install plugins via PlugInstall

Enjoy :)

P.S.: Ah, one more thing. If you can add something new/intresting to this config - feel free to write me about it.
